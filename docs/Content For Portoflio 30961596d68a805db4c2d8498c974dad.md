She/Her

BBA student at RV University with a focus on finance, complemented by hands-on experience across operations, financial analysis, and market research. I am deeply interested in integrating financial systems with technology to build structured, scalable, and impact-driven solutions.

My academic grounding in finance is strengthened by real-world application, most notably through my finance internship at Outlook Publishing (India) Pvt. Ltd., where I applied analytical thinking to structured financial tasks. Across roles in corporate, publishing, and community-driven environments, I have developed a balanced professional approach rooted in clarity, communication, and disciplined execution.

**PiggyWise**

PiggyWise is a concept-driven initiative aimed at making financial literacy engaging and accessible, especially for young individuals. It focuses on building structured financial habits through interactive and intuitive digital experiences.

The mission is to design a platform that makes it easy for users to learn about money, discuss it openly, and track their financial journey with clarity and purpose. By combining user experience design, behavioral insights, and robust technology, the goal is to support micro-habits, goal setting, and progress tracking in a stigma-free and empowering environment.

The vision is to cultivate a generation that approaches money with confidence, curiosity, and clarity. Financial literacy should be proactive, inclusive, and human-centered — not reactive or intimidating. PiggyWise envisions financial education as a lifelong companion that evolves with the user and strengthens both financial capability and financial mindset.
